Where you where you at when all I did was grind
Slice of life, no piece of cake, I need a piece of mind
Stacking on prices, these prices getting higher by the time
so where you where you at when I was tryna get a dime, uh

You cannot come to me now, huh
Now that I'm known all around, huh
The fact of the matter's im practically happy
I'm racking enough for my rib to live lavish

I'm savage, and I'm still below 21
